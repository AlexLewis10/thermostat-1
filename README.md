## User Stories

```
As a user,
So the temperature is automatically nice,
I want my default temperature to be 20.
```

## Approach

I have created a Thermostat object, with a temp of 20.

## User Interface
The interface will need some buttons to do the following:

- Increase temperature
- Decrease temperature
- Reset temperature
- Powersaving On
- Powersaving Off

It will also need to display the following:

- Temperature
- Energy usage
- Shows whether Powersaving is on
